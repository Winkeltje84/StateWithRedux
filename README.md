# State With Redux

This is a repo for tracking my steps in the Modern React with Redux Udemy course by Stephen Grider. For this excersize we learned how to connect React to Redux and get data from the Redux store rendered in our React app.

## Current state
So far I have just followed the course but have added a little bit of extra styling. I might pick this one up again lateron allthough I'm expecting a lot more exciting projects to come up with this course!
